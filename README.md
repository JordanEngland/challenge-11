## Description

in this project i tried to create an express.js app and it hasn't gone very well at all. I still cant get the front end to connect to the back and cant figure it out. from this project i learned that middleware and express are some of the most difficult things ive tried to learn some far. still reading up on them and hopefully one day soon i can understand them. heroku has also been quite the challenge to understand and get to work as well. i hope to gain more of an understanding of this as soon as i can. i was looking forward to creating this app and using it. maybe in the future i can come back to this and make it work.
